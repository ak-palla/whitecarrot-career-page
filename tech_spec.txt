Assumptions:
- One recruiter can create and own multiple companies
- Each company has exactly one owner
- No team collaboration features implemented
- No permission levels or role-based access control
- Primary login uses Supabase Auth 
- Session-based authentication via cookies

File Upload Limits:
- Images (logos/banners)**: 25MB limit, compressed before upload
- Videos: 100MB limit, Direct upload to Supabase Storage
- CSV files:10MB

Considerations:
- Jobs pagination: 20 items per page on frontend
- Database indexes optimize common queries
- Client-side filtering with memoization
- Server-side pagination support 


Recruiter Workflow:
- Recruiters start with empty companies
- Must add jobs manually via UI
- Can use CSV upload feature for bulk import


Architecture Decisions
